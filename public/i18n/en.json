      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can I use the favicons for commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Yes! Favicons generated under our Pro and Business plans come with a full commercial license, allowing you to use them for any business or client project without attribution."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What if I'm not happy with the generated favicons?",
        "answer": "You can generate multiple sets of favicons by tweaking your text prompt. Our free plan allows for 10 generations per month, while paid plans offer unlimited generations, so you can keep trying until you find the perfect design."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Do I need any design skills to use this tool?",
        "answer": "Not at all! Our tool is designed for everyone, regardless of their design experience. If you can describe what you want, our AI can create it for you. It's the simplest way to get a professional favicon."
